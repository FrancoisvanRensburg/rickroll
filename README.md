## React Native Expo Project - Rick and Morty GraphQL
This project is a React Native Expo application that utilizes the Rick and Morty GraphQL API to display all the characters in the show. In addition, the application allows users to upload videos in binary format and also has push notifications implemented.

Getting Started
To run this application, you will need to have Node.js and the Expo CLI installed on your machine. You can install Expo CLI using the following command:

`npm install -g expo-cli`

Next, you will need to clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git`

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
